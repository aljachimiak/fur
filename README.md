# FUR

Fur is a experiment to reproduce git functionality using `bash` and `ruby`.

## Why Fur?
Fur has been named as a letter translation from git.  If you take a look your keyboard, move each keystroke from `git` one to the left and you will get `fur`.

This is a nod to the [often mistaken](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000#Origin_of_name) origin of the name for HAL 9000.

## Getting Started
Run `fur help` for a list of commands available

## Thanks!
A big thank you to [Dave Jachimiak](https://github.com/davejachimiak) for providing the Ruby logic.  This project would not have been possible without his help!
