# FUR

Fur is a experiment to reproduce git functionality using `bash` and `ruby`.

## Why Fur?
Fur has been named as a letter translation from git.  If you take a look your keyboard, move each keystroke from `git` one to the left and you will get `fur`.

This is a nod to the [often mistaken](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000#Origin_of_name) origin of the name for HAL 9000.

## What is it?
````
Fur is a version control system for mammals
````
Fur is a *very* simple version control system for individuals.  It is meant to introduce the concept of version control and practice a workflow that incorparates version control.

## Thanks!
A big thank you to [Dave Jachimiak](https://github.com/davejachimiak) for providing the Ruby logic.  This project would not have been possible without his help!
